Magnesium gluconate is a pharmaceutical/nutraceutical compound used as a source of magnesium ion. The recent study described the impact of The Trivedi Effect®-Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment on magnesium gluconate for the variation in physicochemical, structural, thermal and behavioral properties using PXRD, PSD, FT-IR, UV-vis spectroscopy, TGA, and DSC analysis. Magnesium gluconate was divided into two parts – one part was control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while another part was treated with The Trivedi Effect®-Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment remotely by twenty renowned Biofield Energy Healers and defined as The Trivedi Effect® Treated sample. The PXRD analysis exhibited that the crystallite size of the treated sample was remarkably altered from -70% to 130% compared with the control sample. The average crystallite size was significantly decreased by 23.74% in the treated sample compared to the control sample. Biofield Energy Healing Treatment significantly reduced the particle size of magnesium gluconate at d10, d50, and d90 values by 12.15%, 8.98% and 15.35%, respectively compared to the control sample. The surface area analysis showed that surface area of the treated sample was significantly increased by 11.76% compared with the control sample. The FT-IR and UV-vis analysis displayed that structure of the magnesium gluconate persisted identical in both the treated and control samples. The TGA analysis exhibited four steps thermal degradation in both samples and the total weight loss of the Biofield Energy Treated sample was reduced by 0.19% compared with the control sample. The melting temperature of the Biofield Energy Treated sample (171.25ºC) was slightly (0.16%) higher from the control sample (170.97ºC). The latent heat of fusion was significantly decreased by 7.76% in the treated sample compared to the control sample. The TGA and DSC analysis revealed that the thermal stability of the treated sample was enhanced compared with the control sample. The current study revealed that The Trivedi Effect®-Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment might produce a new polymorphic form of magnesium gluconate, which could be more soluble and bioavailable along with improved thermal stability compared with the untreated compound. The Biofield Treated sample could be more stable during manufacturing, delivery or storage conditions than the untreated sample. Hence, The Trivedi Effect® Treated magnesium gluconate would be very useful to design better nutraceutical/pharmaceutical formulations that might offer better therapeutic responses against inflammatory diseases, immunological disorders, stress, aging, and other chronic infections.

Sebagian karakter yang diterangkan dalam syariat Islam adalah karakter kemandirian, kemandirian dalam mempertanggungjawabkan prilaku dan perbuatannya di hadapan Allah kemudian di hadapan hukum dan perundang-undangan yang berlaku dimana seseorang berada. Kemandirian ini diberlakukan mulai dari seorang anak sampai pada status akil baligh. Ditinjau dari perspektif pendidikan, bahwa masa akil baligh adalah masa ia telah mendapatkan bekal pemahaman yang cukup untuk bekal ia sebagai seorang muslim yang mulai berdiri sendiri dengan tanggungjawab personal dihadapan Tuhannya. Masa Baligh adalah sebuah fase baru dalam kehidupan setiap muslim yang harus dihadapi oleh mereka dengan bekal karakter kemandirian yang memadahi, dan karakter kemandirian ini ternyata harus by design disebabkan tuntutan umur, yaitu minimal pada umur 15 tahun, setiap pribadi muslim sudah mempunyai kemampuan yang menjadikan mereka berdiri sendiri dalam mempertanggungjawabkan semua sikap, tindakan dan prilakunya. Berangkat dari hal di atas, pembentukan karakter kemandirian pada seorang anak adalah tanggungjawab orangtua dan pemerintah melalui kurikulum pendidikan. Metode penulisan yang digunakan adalah kajian pustaka Dr. Yusuf Al Qaradhawi terhadap Al Quran dan Sunnah terkait dengan aktivitas usaha yang bisa di lakukan seseorang, sehingga dari tulisan ini diharapkan dapat memudahkan dalam upaya membuat panduan program dan muatan kemandirian dalam kurikulum pendidikan kedepannya.

Market Value of Share of a company is determined by various factors. So many studies were conducted in finding the determinants of share price. Some of the studies found that Capital Structure is a determinant of the market price of the share and some of the studies found that Earning per Share is a determinant of the market price of the share. Even some studies proved that Capital Structure is also determining the Earning per Share. With this ideology an attempt was made in this study by using Structural equation modeling to see how for the Capital Structure of the firm has got a direct and indirect effect over the Market value of share. Debt to Total Assets, Equity to Total Assets, Coverage Ratio, Earning per share and Market price of share of eleven Indian public sector banks were taken for the study for five years from March 2013 to March 2017.

Withania somnifera (Ashwagandha) root extract is very popular ancient herbal medicine. The objective of the study was to characterize and evaluate the impact of The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment (Biofield Energy Healing) on phytoconstituents present in the ashwagandha root extract using GC-MS and NMR. Ashwagandha root extract was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control, while the other part was defined as The Trivedi Effect® - Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received The Trivedi Effect® - Energy of Consciousness Healing Treatment remotely from eighteen renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The GC-MS data indicated that the peak height and peak area of The Trivedi Effect® treated sample were found to be altered compared with the control sample. The peak height of the phytoconstituents present in the treated ashwagandha sample was altered significantly in the range of -8.32% to 89.25% compared with the control sample. Similarly, the peak area of the treated sample was altered significantly in the range of - 4.28% to 216.30% compared with the control sample. Overall, the change in the peak area% of the treated sample was significantly altered in the range of -18.29% to 170.18% compared with the control sample. The GC-MS and NMR analysis results identified the presence of withanolides such as glyco-withanolides, alkaloids, and sugars in the root extract in both the sample. The peak area of 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridazine (1), methyl ethyl sulfoxide (2), 5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-4(H)pyran-3,4-dione (4), diethoxy-2-methyl-propane (5), 2,3,4,5-tetrahydroxy-tetrahydro-pyran (6), and 3,4-dimethyl-2(3H)-furanone (7) were significantly increased by 170.18%, 58.21%, 7.74%, 139.50%, 23.16%, and 45.63%, respectively in the treated sample compared with the control sample. On the contrary, the peak area% of 2-hydroxy-γ-butyrolactone (3) was decreased by - 14.96% in the treated ashwagandha compared with the control sample. From the results, it can be hypothesized that The Trivedi Effect® - Biofield Energy Treatment might have the impact on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the phytoconstituents present in the ashwagandha root extract and responsible for the alteration in the relative peak height/area of treated sample compared with the control sample. As a result, the concentrations of the phytoconstituents assumed to be increased in treated sample compared with the control sample. This treated ashwagandha root extract would be helpful for designing better nutraceutical/pharmaceutical formulations which might be providing a better therapeutic response against autoimmune diseases, nervous and sexual disorders, infectious diseases, antiaging, diabetes, cancer, immunological disorders, stress, arthritis, etc.

Men who have sex with men (MSM) who use crystal methamphetamine (CM) are at increased risk for HIV infection. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a useful HIV prevention strategy if individuals can identify high-risk exposures and seek timely care, however, to date there has been limited data on the use of PEP by CM users. • Few studies have investigated biomedical HIV prevention interventions for men who have sex with men who use crystal methamphetamine (CM). • This study investigated the use of CM by MSM who sought post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). • MSM who use CM had higher risk exposures during the event that led to seeking PEP. • MSM who use CM also had greater recurrent exposure to HIV following PEP use. • HIV prevention interventions that address both recurrent HIV exposure and substance use may be particularly effective

Herbomineral formulations have increased in recognition and popularity due to their high safety and better therapeutic action. A new proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with a mixture of the herbal root extract of ashwagandha and three minerals viz. zinc, magnesium, and selenium. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the test formulation when applied to splenocyte cells isolated from the Biofield Treated mice. The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment. The other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely by seven renowned Biofield Energy Healers. A wide concentration range (0.00001053 to 10.53 µg/mL) of the test formulation was used to determine non-cytotoxic concentrations using MTT assay. Further, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, MIP-1α, and IL-1β) was determined by ELISA method. The test formulation was evaluated and found to be safe up to 1.053 µg/mL with a percentage cell viability range of 73% to 97% using MTT assay. The Biofield Treated formulation improved the cell viability up to 6.61% compared with the untreated test formulation. TNF-α expression was significantly inhibited by 16.72% at 0.1053 µg/mL compared with the untreated test formulation, however expression was significantly altered by 53.67% and 25.62% at 0.01053 and 1.053 µg/mL, respectively compared to the untreated test formulation. TNF-α expression was also suppressed in the Biofield Treated test formulation at 0.001053 and 0.1053 µg/mL by 4.0% and 8.56%, respectively as compared with the vehicle control. MIP-1α suppression was reported in the Biofield Treated test formulation at 0.00001053 to 1.053 µg/mL by 8.43%, 22.02%, 21.92%, 20.54%, 5.40%, and 19.82%, respectively compared with the vehicle control. However, the Biofield Treated formulation further exhibited substantial suppression of MIP-1α at 0.0001053, 0.001053, 0.01053, and 0.1053 µg/mL by 13.50%, 7.38%, 36.83% (p≤0.001), and 2.53%, respectively compared with the untreated test formulation. In addition, significant inhibition of IL-1β secretion was reported in the Biofield Treated formulation at 0.0001053, 0.001053, 0.01053, and 0.01053 µg/mL by 32.40%, 14.99%, 60.42%, and 15.15%, respectively compared with the untreated test formulation. The Biofield Energy Healing Treatment significantly potentiated the immunosuppressive effect of the test formulation in Biofield Treated mouse splenocytes, which can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management and anti-aging by improving overall health.

Cryptocurrency Quasi cooperative refers to a condition when the cooperative is not a cooperative. The legal cooperative is bound to the basic principles of cooperatives and the prevailing laws and regulations. Thus it is quite easy to find and recognize a quasi cooperative. If a cooperative does not implement the basic principles of cooperatives and not in accordance with applicable legislation, then the cooperative can be categorized as a quasi cooperative. The inability of the cooperative as a self-help organization is partly due to the non involvement of members in the decision making process and the preparation of cooperative programs. Member participation is only taken into account when attending Annual Members Meeting (RAT), paying cooperative deposits, and making transactions with cooperatives. The implementation of cooperative activities and businesses is more dominated by the management and managers who seem to know what is best for the cooperative. Currently there are many cooperative management patterns applied in almost all companies including some state owned enterprises that have applied the concept of profit sharing and employee participation, namely moving the participation of workers/employees in corporate decision making, especially related to the principle of profit and risk sharing. The purpose of this study is to reduce the negative impact of quasi cooperatives that greatly make big losses for the community as members of the cooperative who trust the pattern of management. This study uses Literature study methods collected from previous studies on the pattern of cooperative management and the influence of trust members of the cooperative on the development of cooperatives in Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that many quasi cooperatives that flourish in Indonesia develops and this is due to the level of trust members of the cooperative against the quasi cooperative. It is hoped that this research will be one of the sources of comparison for all components of cooperative managers who have been given trust by members, in order not to run things that mengarhkan cooperatives managed to be a quasi cooperative, because of course this will be bad for the development of cooperatives in Indonesia.

ABSTRACT
The study aimed to identify deterioration problems, repair and conservation needs of andesites on the walls of the Ankara Castle. Decay forms of walls were documented by visual examination. Samples taken from the surface of the weathered andesites were examined for their basic physical, mechanical compositional and minerological properties. The bulk density and total porosity were determined as basic physical properties. The mechanical properties were expressed as ultrasonic velocity and modulus of elasticity (Emod). Compositional and mineralogical properties were determined by optical microscopy and XRD analyses. Soluble salt content of the andesite samples was determined by spot tests of anions and electrical conductivity measurements. Findings were evaluated in terms of the long-term weathering behaviour of andesites under the effect of the prevailing climate, air pollution problems of Ankara, dampness problems of the structure, previous repairs with incompatible cement mortars. The surfaces of Ankara Castle andesite blocks were heavily weathered. The results were compared with the physical and mechanical properties of fresh andesites from Gölbaşı- Ankara quarry. The surface of the andesite blocks at the Ankara Castle, had low bulk density and high porosity, low ultrasonic velocity and low Emod values. Thin section and XRD analyses supported those results by revealing the presence of physical and chemical weathering on feldspars and other main minerals of andesite, as well as the presence of amorphous minerals at the surface.

A proprietary herbomineral formulation was formulated with four ingredients; a mixture of the minerals (zinc, magnesium, and selenium) and the herbal root extract ashwagandha. The aim of the study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory potential of Biofield Energy Healing (The Trivedi Effect®) on the herbomineral formulation in splenocyte cells, which were isolated from Biofield Treated mice. The test formulation was divided into two parts. One part was denoted as the control without any Biofield Energy Treatment, while the other part was defined as the Biofield Energy Treated sample, which received the Biofield Energy Healing Treatment remotely from seven renowned Biofield Energy Healers. The splenocyte cells were treated with the test formulation at concentrations ranges from 0.00001053 to 10.53 µg/mL and analyzed after 48 hours of treatment by MTT assay. The cell viability data showed safe concentrations up to 1.053 µg/mL with viability ranges from 69.22% to 123.88% in the test formulation groups. The expression of TNF-α was decreased by 4.82% at 1.053 µg/mL in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation compared with the vehicle control. The level of TNF-α was significantly decreased by 2.02%, 4.92%, and 18.78% at 0.00001053, 0.001053, and 1.053 µg/mL, respectively in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation group as compared to the untreated test formulation. The expression of IL-1β was significantly reduced by 83.65%, 92.15%, 27.30%, and 41.88% at 0.00001053, 0.0001053, 0.001053, and 1.053 µg/mL, respectively in the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation compared with the vehicle control. The Biofield Treated test formulation showed significant reduction of IL-1β by 17.26%, 92.61% (p≤0.001), 34.62% (p≤0.05), and 16.13% at 0.00001053, 0.0001053, 0.001053, and 1.053 µg/mL, respectively compared with the untreated test formulation. Additionally, the expression of chemokine MIP-1α was significantly reduced by 17.03%, 10.99%, 22.33%, 24.21%, 21.61%, and 30.67% at 0.00001053, 0.0001053, 0.001053, 0.01053, 0.1053, and 1.053 µg/mL, respectively in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared with the vehicle control. The MIP-1α expression was significantly reduced by 19.32% and 12.56% at 0.01053 and 0.1053 µg/mL, respectively in the Biofield Treated test formulation compared with the untreated test formulation. The overall results demonstrated that the Biofield Energy Treated test formulation significantly down-regulated the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and MIP-1α in the Biofield Treated mice splenocyte cells compared to the untreated test formulation. These data suggest that the Biofield Treated test formulation can be used for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, stress management and anti-aging by improving overall health.
